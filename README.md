## Attention_layer
Attention machanism is a technique developped to minic cognitive attention. Attention allow to focus on the specific objects for observations. The attention mechanism is a neural network that simulates the attentions of brain. It has been successfully applied to text translation, video analysis and other related Ô¨Åelds. Applying the attention mechanism to the deep neural network allows the neural network to adaptively focus on input features that are more significant to the current output, and mitigate the interference of other features. 
Attention layer is applied to hidden layer output vector, it will look for attention weight of hidden layer and cam be calculate as:

The attention vector can be computed as follows:
